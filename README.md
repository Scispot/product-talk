# Scispot Product Requests

In this repository you will find links to our documentation, training videos, and a discussion board. Feel free to share feedback, discuss topics with other community members, or ask questions.

Check out our community articles and training videos [here](https://github.com/Scispot/product-talk/discussions/categories/scispot-education).

## Product Feedback

These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the Scispot product team. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

## Discussions Categories

When creating a new post, make sure to choose the predetermined category that best fits your topic. This will ensure that conversations are indexed by their corresponding product or feature, to help community members quickly find answers to their questions.

Discussion categories have been established for specific features listed above, as well as a general category for other topics. Additional categories may be added in the future. In the meantime, topics outside of the listed categories above, will be transferred into the General category.

## Making Suggestions

We encourage you to open a discussion if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion.

Prior to creating a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already shared your suggestion(s). If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new one.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion, the Scispot product team will evaluate the feedback. From there, we will work with you, and the entire community, to ensure we understand the current capabilities Scispot doesnâ€™t have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement:

- If the product team determines that we are going to prioritize a feature to solve the problem you've identified, we may open an issue internally and keep you updated with any and all progress.
- If the product team determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified, we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.
